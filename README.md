[00:13.55] You know
[00:16.16] The fire is running low
[00:19.60] Can you feel the flame, her fading glow?
[00:23.87] You know
[00:26.73] We are slowing down
[00:30.10] I can hear your footsteps drowning out
[00:49.10] 
[00:34.17] We're burning up
[00:36.75] We're burning down
[00:41.02] We're the ashes on the ground
[00:44.50] We're burning down
[00:47.25] We're burning down
[00:51.51] We're falling underground
[01:04.01] 
[00:54.87] You are
[00:57.51] You're singing now a song
[01:01.26] But you heard it somewhere else I know
[01:05.38] We are
[01:07.99] We're trying to belong
[01:11.77] Pick up the pieces left of us
[01:26.27] 
[01:15.60] We're burning up
[01:18.24] We're burning down
[01:22.41] We're the ashes on the ground
[01:25.91] We're burning down
[01:28.88] We're burning down
[01:32.70] We're falling underground
[01:45.20] 
[01:36.25] If you could see me running up to you
[01:40.35] You'd know
[01:42.65] I've been running in circles around you
[01:46.55] If you could tell me I was back in time
[01:50.88] You'd know
[01:53.02] I've been running in circles for you
[02:11.02] 
[01:57.22] We're burning up
[01:59.83] We're burning down
[02:03.98] We're the ashes on the ground
[02:07.73] We're burning up
[02:10.30] We're burning down
[02:14.43] We're falling underground
[02:26.93] 
[02:18.03] The lie has fallen from the stars
[02:24.48] Now you're sinking through the night
[02:28.17] Out of sight, we're falling underground
[02:34.85] Pick up the pieces left of us
[02:49.35] 
[02:38.49] If you could see me running up to you
[02:42.73] You'd know
[02:44.97] I've been running in circles around you
[02:48.96] If you could tell me I was back in time
[02:53.15] You'd know
[02:55.43] I've been running in circles for you
[03:13.43] 
[02:59.45] We're burning up
[03:02.04] We're burning down
[03:06.30] We're the ashes on the ground
[03:09.96] We're burning up
[03:12.67] We're burning down
[03:16.71] We're falling underground
[03:29.21] 
[03:20.08] We're burning up
[03:22.75] We're burning down
[03:27.01] We're the ashes on the ground
[03:30.53] We're burning up
[03:33.21] We're burning down
[03:37.47] We're falling underground
[03:49.97] 
[03:46.69] You know
[03:49.49] The fire is running low
